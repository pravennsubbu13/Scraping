How to read and understand this benefit illustration?
This benefit illustration is intended to show year wise premiums payable and benefits under the policy, at two assumed rates of interest i.e., 8% p.a. and 4% p.a. 
"Some benefits are guaranteed and some benefits are variable with returns based on the future performance of your insurer carrying on life insurance business. If your policy offers guaranteed benefits then
these will be clearly marked "guaranteed" in the illustration table on this page. If your policy offers variable benefits then the illustrations on this page will show two different rates of assumed future investment
returns, of 8% p.a. and 4% p.a. These assumed rates of return are not guaranteed and they are not the upper or lower limits of what you might get back, as the value of your policy is dependent on a number
of factors including future investment performance."
